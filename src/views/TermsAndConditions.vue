      By participating in this multi-task benchmark of Arabic language understanding evaluation (ALUE),  you agree to these terms and conditions (the “<strong>Terms and Conditions</strong>”). If, however, you have any concern regarding one or more of the Terms and Conditions, you can send us an email to <a href="to:alue@mawdoo3.com">alue@mawdoo3.com</a> and we will review and consider if an exception can be made.
      <ul>
      <li>By submitting results to this competition, you consent to the public release of your scores at this website and in any associated publication or websites, at the task organizers' discretion. Scores may include, but are not limited to, automatic and manual quantitative judgements, qualitative judgements, and such other metrics as the task organizers see fit. You accept that the ultimate decision of metric choice and score value is that of the task organizers.</li>
      <li>You further agree that the task organizers are under no obligation to release scores and that scores may be withheld if it is the task organizers' judgement that the submission was incomplete, erroneous, deceptive, or violated the letter or spirit of the competition's rules. Inclusion of a submission's scores is not an endorsement of a team or individual's submission, system, or science.</li>
      <li>A participant can be involved in exactly one team (no more). If there are reasons why it makes sense for you to be on more than one team, then email us before the evaluation period begins. In special circumstances this may be allowed.</li>
      <li>Each team/participant must create and use exactly one account per a defined model.</li>
      <li>During the evaluation:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You will not be able to see results of your submission on the test set.</li>
        <li>You will be able to see any warnings and errors for each of your submissions.</li>
        <li>Leaderboard might be disabled until the test results are verified by the organizers</li>
      </ul>
      <li>We will make the final submissions of the participants public after the evaluation at the time determined by us.</li>
      <li>The primary ALUE tasks are built on and derived from existing datasets. We refer users to the original licenses accompanying each dataset. Therefore, you need to check and accept these original licenses prior to the use of these datasets. </li>
      <li>The organizers and their affiliated companies make no warranties regarding the datasets provided, including but not limited to being correct or complete. They cannot be held liable for providing access to the datasets or the usage of the datasets.</li>
      <li>The dataset should only be used for scientific or research purposes. Any other use is explicitly prohibited.</li>
      <li>The datasets must not be redistributed or shared in part or full with any third party. Redirect interested parties to this website.</li>
      <li>If you publish a scientific paper or an article about the results on the benchmark, you must cite associated paper (or article) of each dataset of each task in addition to citation the ALUE paper (coming soon in ArXiv then in a conference proceeding)</li>
      </ul>
